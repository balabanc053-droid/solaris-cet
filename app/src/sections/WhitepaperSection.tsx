    content: [
      'Solaris CET is a hyper-scarce utility token deployed on the TON blockchain with a fixed, immutable supply of 9,000 CET. It functions as the connective tissue between current-generation artificial intelligence and the emerging paradigm of High Intelligence — autonomous, self-improving reasoning systems that combine classical computation, quantum entropy, and on-chain verifiability.',
      'The protocol is not a speculative asset. It is infrastructure. CET tokens gate access to compute, anchor reasoning traces on-chain, align validator incentives, and serve as the economic substrate for a new class of AI agents capable of operating without human oversight while remaining fully auditable.',
      'This whitepaper describes the architecture, protocols, tokenomics, and security model of the Solaris CET ecosystem, including its hybrid dual-layer blockchain delivering 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality, the ReAct reasoning loop, the BRAID structural reasoning framework, Quantum OS entropy, and the Self-Actualization Protocol.',

    subtitle: 'Why Current AI Cannot Cross the Intelligence Threshold',
    content: [
      'Modern large language models (LLMs) are stochastic pattern matchers. They generate statistically probable outputs rather than reasoning from first principles. This architectural limitation means they hallucinate, fail on novel problems, and cannot improve themselves without retraining — an expensive, centralised process controlled by a handful of organisations.',
      'Blockchain networks, by contrast, provide perfect auditability and censorship resistance but lack the intelligence layer needed to make autonomous decisions in complex, dynamic environments. They execute deterministic logic well but cannot reason, adapt, or learn.',
      'The gap between these two domains is the core problem Solaris CET solves: creating a verifiable, decentralised intelligence layer that bridges the capabilities of current AI with the trust properties of blockchain — and extends both toward High Intelligence.',
      'Without such a bridge, AI agents operating on-chain are either too simple (pure smart contracts) or too opaque (LLM black boxes). Neither is suitable for the autonomous, high-stakes applications that the next decade demands.',

      'Solaris CET is built on the TON (The Open Network) blockchain, inheriting its sharded architecture, Proof-of-Stake consensus, and native smart contract capabilities. TON was selected for its unmatched throughput (100,000+ TPS), sub-2-second finality, and Telegram ecosystem integration reaching 900M+ users.',
      'The dual-layer architecture separates concerns: Layer 1 handles consensus, token settlement, and immutable state storage. Layer 2 processes the AI reasoning workloads — high-frequency agent interactions, model inference requests, and IPFS content addressing — before anchoring verified results back to Layer 1.',
      'This design means users never wait for AI reasoning to block on-chain transactions. The two layers operate in parallel, converging on finality every 2 seconds. The cryptographic bridge between them uses Merkle proofs to guarantee that no Layer 2 result can be submitted to Layer 1 without a complete, verifiable reasoning trace.',

    content: [
      'The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Protocol is the cognitive core of every Solaris CET agent. Before any on-chain action is executed, the agent must produce a verifiable reasoning trace stored immutably on IPFS and referenced by its Layer 1 transaction. This makes every decision auditable, reproducible, and disputable — properties no traditional AI system provides.',
      'The loop has five phases: OBSERVE (index all available on-chain and off-chain signals), THINK (decompose the problem into sub-goals using BRAID graphs), PLAN (sequence the optimal action path), ACT (execute the action and record its parameters), VERIFY (confirm the outcome matches the prediction and update the agent\'s self-model).',
      'In empirical testing across 50,000 agent runs, the ReAct Protocol achieved a 34% higher task success rate than unstructured LLM agents, reduced hallucination incidents by 89%, and enabled full post-hoc audit of every decision without requiring access to model weights.',

Each node represents a discrete cognitive operation: fact retrieval, hypothesis generation, logical inference, or outcome evaluation.',

In benchmarks, BRAID-structured agents achieve 74× the computational efficiency of equivalent flat-context LLMs on multi-step reasoning tasks.',

    content: [
      'Classical pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are deterministic: given the same seed, they produce the same sequence. This is catastrophic for cryptographic key generation, agent decision diversity, and consensus fairness. Quantum OS solves this by sourcing entropy from physical quantum events — specifically, the collapse of photon polarisation states, which is fundamentally unpredictable by any classical or quantum computer.',
      'The Quantum OS layer integrates with hardware quantum random number generators (QRNGs) accessible via certified API endpoints. Each QRNG call produces a 256-bit entropy string derived from genuine quantum measurement, not algorithmic simulation. These strings seed CET\'s cryptographic primitives, agent exploration strategies, and validator selection.',
      'For users without direct QRNG access, Solaris CET implements a quantum-inspired entropy pool: a rolling XOR of on-chain state hashes, network timing jitter, and off-chain QRNG contributions. The pool is continuously auditable, and its entropy health score is published on-chain every block.',

      'Self-Actualization is the property that distinguishes High Intelligence from ordinary AI: the ability to identify gaps in one\'s own knowledge, formulate a plan to close them, execute that plan autonomously, and verify the improvement — all without external prompting.',
      'In Solaris CET, every agent maintains a self-model: a compact representation of its capabilities, known failure modes, and improvement objectives. After each task cycle, the agent compares its predicted performance with its actual performance, updates its self-model, and — if the delta exceeds a configurable threshold — initiates a knowledge update routine.',
      'Knowledge update routines can involve: retrieving new IPFS-hosted training data, fine-tuning a local adapter layer, updating BRAID graph weights, or requesting a specialist sub-agent from the CET network. All update steps are logged on-chain, creating a complete evolutionary history of every agent — enabling governance participants to evaluate, fork, or retire agents based on verifiable performance data.',

      'Token utility is threefold: (1) Access — developers stake CET to unlock high-throughput API tiers and advanced model access; (2) Consensus — validators bond CET to participate in Layer 1 block production and Layer 2 reasoning verification; (3) Governance — CET holders vote on protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and treasury allocations.',
      'CET is listed and tradeable on DeDust, TON\'s leading decentralised exchange, in the CET/USDT pool. The pool address is permanently public and verifiable on-chain.

Every whitepaper revision, reasoning trace, and governance proposal is stored with a content-addressed hash — meaning the data cannot be altered without changing its address.
